Project Title: Online Quiz Application 
Project Description: 
Create an Online Quiz Application in Java that allows users to take quizzes on various topics. The 
application should support multiple-choice questions, track user progress, and provide feedback on 
quiz performance. 
Project Requirements: 
1. User Authentication: - Implement a login system where users can create an account or log in with existing credentials. 
2. Quiz Management: - Allow administrators to create quizzes with multiple-choice questions. - Each question should have a title, options, and correct answer(s). - Enable administrators to edit and delete quizzes. 
3. Quiz Taking: - Users should be able to select and take quizzes from the available list of topics. - Display one question at a time with options for the user to select the answer(s). - Provide feedback on each question (correct/incorrect) immediately after the user submits their 
answer. 
4. Scoring and Progress Tracking: - Calculate and display the user's score at the end of each quiz. - Track user progress by recording quiz attempts and scores. - Allow users to view their past quiz attempts and scores. 
5. Leaderboard: (optional) - Implement a leaderboard to display top scorers for each quiz or overall. - Rank users based on their total scores or average scores. 
6. User Interface: - Design a user-friendly interface using JavaFX, Swing or any other language as per your choice for a 
smooth user experience. - Ensure clarity and consistency in the layout and navigation. 
7. Data Persistence: - Use a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, etc.) to store user accounts, quizzes, questions, and quiz 
results. - Implement CRUD operations using JDBC for database interaction. 
8. Error Handling and Validation:(optional) - Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages to users. - Validate user input to prevent errors and ensure data integrity. 
9. Security Considerations: - Implement password hashing and salting to securely store user passwords. 
10. Documentation: (optional) - Provide comprehensive documentation including setup instructions, user guide, and code 
documentation (comments). - Document any assumptions made and limitations of the system. 
Additional Notes: - Consider adding features such as timer-based quizzes, random question selection, and difficulty 
levels for added complexity if time permits. - Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality correctness and reliability.
